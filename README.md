# VNPR-using-Raspberry_pi
It is an individual image processing project on a Raspberry Pi, called 'Vehicle Number Plate Detection.' I created this project from the ground up, handling everything from writing the code, training models,
defining the problem, and implementing the solution. The main goal of this project was to automatically detect and read license plate numbers from vehicle images.
